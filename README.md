# full-stack-website
This is a full stack website that takes data from the user and saves it into a database.
TO use the code of this project node js, express js and pug must be downloaded in your system. I used some other extensions like mongoose and body parser to connect with
a database, for storing all the data I used here Mongodb. So these are the basic needed tools for this website.
